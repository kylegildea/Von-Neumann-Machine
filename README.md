# Von-Neumann-Machine
Using C programming language write a program that simulates the Tiny Machine Architecture. Your code must implement the basic instruction set that the Tiny Machine Architecture adheres to (LOAD[1], ADD[2], STORE[3], SUB[4], IN[5], OUT[6], END[7], JMP[8], SKIPZ[9]). Each piece of the architecture must be accurately represented in your code (Instruction Register, Program Counter, Memory Address Register, Data Memory, Memory Data Register, and Accumulator). Data Memory will be represented by a 0-9 array. Your Program Counter will begin at 10.For the sake of simplicity Program Memoryand Data Memory may be implemented as separate arrays.
